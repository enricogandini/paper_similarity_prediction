# Molecular Similarity Survey
Many thanks for taking part in this research project on molecular similarity.

You will be presented 5 pairs of molecules. For each pair of molecules you are asked to judge whether you consider them to be similar or not similar.
There are no right or wrong answers.
The whole survey should take you about 5 minutes to complete, so do not spend more than 1 minute on each pair of molecules.
Please complete the whole survey in a single session.

The survey is completely anonymous, no sensitive information is stored.
The survey will start when you select "I Accept". If you want to quit the survey, just close the web page.
